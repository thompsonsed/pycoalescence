It contains all functions for running large&#45;scale simulations backwards in time using coalescence techniques. Outputs include an SQLite database containing spatial and temporal information about tracked lineages, and allow for rebuilding of the coalescence tree. Currently, a fat&#45;tailed dispersal kernel or normal distribution can be used for dispersal processes. " alt="" coords="5,152,127,177"/>
